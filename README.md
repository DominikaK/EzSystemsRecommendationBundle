# Recommendation Bundle
This bundle integrates Recommendation services into eZ Platform. It supports the YooChoose recommender at this moment.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.4.?
- eZ Publish 5.4 or above

## Installation
Run the following from your eZ Publish installation root to get the latest stable version:
```
php composer.phar require ezsystems/recommendation-bundle
```

Enable the bundle in `ezpublish/EzPublishKernel.php`:
```
$bundles = array(
    // existing bundles
    new EzSystems\RecommendationBundle()
);
```

Configure the bundle by setting your own values in `parameters.yml`:
```
parameters:
    ez_recommendation.default.yoochoose.customer_id: "12345"
    ez_recommendation.default.yoochoose.license_key: "1234-5678-9012-3456-7890"
```

## Usage

### Initial setup
Your content structure must be mapped to the YooChoose domain model. This must be done in collaboration with YooChoose.

### Indexing
Content is automatically indexed. When necessary, eZ Publish will notify YooChoose of changes to content. Initial import is to be managed with your YooChoose sales representative. Note that your server's REST API will need to be open to the YooChoose servers for indexing to be possible.

### Tracking
Events from the site needs to be sent to YooChoose so that recommendations can be adapted to visitors. Tracking can be setup in multiple ways, depending on anyone's constraints.

You can find more information on the YooChoose documentation, about [tracking in general](https://doc.yoochoose.net/display/PUBDOC/1.+Tracking+Events), and about the [generic asynchronous javascript tracker](https://doc.yoochoose.net/display/PUBDOC/Tracking+with+yc.js).

#### The item id
The ItemId mentioned throughout this documentation is usually set to the viewed ContentId. Depending on requirements, it can be set to a different value, in collaboration with YooChoose.

## Troubleshooting
Most operations are logged via the `ez_recommendation` [Monolog channel](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/logging/channels_handlers.html). To log everything about Recommendation to dev.recommendation.log, add the following to your `config.yml`:

```
monolog:
    handlers:
        ez_recommendation:
            type:   stream
            path:   "%kernel.logs_dir%/%kernel.environment%.recommendation.log"
            channels: [ez_recommendation]
            level: debug
```

You can replace `debug` by `info` to get less verbosity.
